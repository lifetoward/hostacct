Basic Web Hosting Service
With this service we provide web access to the account's static web content.
We do it directly through the account's virtual host and we do not manage our own server instance.

There are currently 3 different static content repositories we provide access to:

	URL location                Content directory
	------------                -----------------
	$ACCOUNT_DOMAIN/            $ACCOUNT_HOME/static/${site_handle}/
	$ACCOUNT_DOMAIN/backups/    $ACCOUNT_HOME/backups/
