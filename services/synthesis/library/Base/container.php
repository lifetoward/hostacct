<?php
/**
* A Container is an Element which contains a specific and dedicated set of elements of another class which in aggregate constitute a whole.
*
* This scheme is NOT appropriate for use with large or unbounded (growing over time) sets of contained elements.
*	So for example, it is not appropriate to make a ledger account a containing element of accounting entries because those entries will continue to grow over time.
*	However it WOULD be appropriate to have that relationship for an accounting transaction as containing its accounting entries.
*	In the first case, the set of all contained elements would be expected to grow without bound over time, whereas in the latter case the set is finite and manageably limited.
* Other examples of good uses for this containing element relationship:
* 	A compensation card in an HR scenario, in which several compensation claims are aggregated into a meaningful set.
*	Dedicated attachments, ie. where the attached document cannot possibly be meaningfully shared for other uses. (Are such cases possible?)
*
* Contained elements must uniquely and permanently belong to one containing element. They are not transferrable among containing elements.
* Any such contained element should always be created with an express reference to the containing element. The element cannot be valid without such a reference.
* Contained elements are joined in full during the containing element's load query, however they are "grouped", which means you can define derived fields based on their
*	contents during each containing element load.
* These restrictions are placed upon any contained element class in order to participate in this scheme:
*	- It must NOT contain a defined field called "disposition". We reserve this name as an auxiliary value for use in maintaining the latent contained elements.
*	- They must refer to the Container using a type=belong reference; note that both these reference types disallow null values [and cannot be updated]?.
*	- The signature of the contained element's static create() method must be: public static function create( {ContainingClass} $element, array $initialValues = null )
*
* All original code.
