<?php
/**
* DataDirect is a root action (handler) which provides access to Instances directly.
* It loads a requested data object by its class and key(s), and then renders it back using the requested formatting method.
* Not just any method can be invoked this way. It must be listed as an array key in $focus::$directMethods.
* The method's static role requirement can be provided as that array key's value. (If empty, it means, just be authenticated.)
* Available formatting methods depend on the Instance subclass, but some are universal (like JSON).
* Unless you pass a context class to the start() method, we're going to assume you want us to use an AuthSession.
*
* All original code.
