/**
* AJAXAction is a root action which provides access to Instance data directly.
* Usually these are session-authenticated, but that's up to the portal script to decide.
* It loads a requested data object by its class and key(s), and then
* Returns the output of a requested method (via 'method' arg) or "asJSON" to the caller.
* Not just any method can be invoked this way. It must be listed as an array key in the appropriate hint, ie. $focus::$hints['AJAX'][$method]
* The method's static role requirement can be provided as that array key's value. (If empty, it means, just be authenticated.)
* We return all the headers and such presuming JSON data as the sole body.
*
* All original code.

const OLD_CODE = <<<'end'
This older approach to an AJAX action took a more complete and purpose-specific approach which I don't just want to delete yet.
The implementation above is pretty general purpose, but also not informative and perhaps even quite unmanageable under error conditions.

		// The initialization case happens below. We instantiate the requested action and return the INITIAL status.
		if (!class_exists($actionClass = $args['_action']) || !$actionClass instanceof Action)
			exit print json_encode(array('status'=>static::FAIL, 'content'=>"Could not locate the requested action class '$actionClass'."));
		$token = uniqid();
		if (($c->$handler[$token] = new $actionClass($args)) instanceof Action) // Here's the normal case
			exit print json_encode(array_merge($c->$handler[$token]->getResult(), array('token'=>$token)));
		unset($c->$handler[$token]);
		exit print json_encode(array('status'=>static::FAIL, 'content'=>"Unable to construct the requested action '$actionClass'.", 'request'=>$c->request));
