	/**
	* This method is used to produce a result appropriate to an HTML based user-driven scenario.
	* If you want to produce a different type of result (like AJAX or REST), use a different method.
	* Our implementation of render() in this base class provides for an automagic "nesting" facility among actions.
	* Under this scheme, a running action can trigger a subAction which then gets rendered instead of its parent until the subAction exits, etc.
	* We provide this facility by calling the related render_me() and optional envelope() methods.
	* Of course you can override this method if you don't want that kind of behavior.
	* Root actions, for example, typically override this to allow for more than one Action stack or to implement other forms of interaction.
	* For a typical Action which might be useful in many contexts, you would not worry about this stuff, and you would implement render_me() instead of render().
	* @param Context $super The context of the action invoker. We use this to inform our own context where to get exported and general system information which is request-specific.
	* @return Result Like any public method in the Action class, you must return a Result object. The usual goal is to return an HTMLRendering object because only that can
	*	result in a visible HTML panel in a browser as this method is intended to facilitate. However, whenever an Action is done interacting, it returns another Result, typically a Notice, instead.
	*	So as a general rule, you should either return an HTMLRendering (if you action continues to require the attention of the user), or a Notice (if you're done executing).
