* An action's execution method (typically render() or render_me()) assembles and then returns one of these result objects.
* Nothing about this kind of object persists across multiple requests... it's entirely for assembling the result of a single request; it is not persistent in the session.
* A result in its most common form may be rendered as HTML, formatted as plain text, or logged to the established log streams.
* Any result can nest an array of results generated from actions directly nested by the action which constructed this result.
* Assembly of a result for output is presumed to include nested results as well. How they are all assembled depends on the nesting result.
