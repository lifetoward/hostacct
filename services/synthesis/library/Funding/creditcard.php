* A credit card facilitates purchase payments. It's not always hooked to a credit line... it could just as well be hooked to a current asset bank account.
* If the card is associated with a bank account then it's a card owned by the focal entity and that's the account that will register the charges made, ie. what we'll use to reconcile its purchases.
* Without a bank account, the card is owned by another entity. Such cards are used for accepting payment from clients rather than making payments to vendors.
