#  cron.sh
#  cron executes this script directly on behalf of the WebAdmin (ubuntu).
#
# First we partition hour hourly dispatches into these periods:
#       hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
# We execute the hourly tasks to completion before the daily, then the weekly, etc.
# Thus the entire process is synchronous and sequenced from most common to least common tasks.
#
# Within that periodic framework we:
#  - take care of proxy maintenance jobs
#  - dispatch `$ACCOUNT_HOME/scripts/cron.sh { period }` for each registered hostacct under $ADMIN_HOME/accounts/.
#
# Thus the entire set of procedures across all accounts is synchronized in a predictable sequence.
# This is deemed to be safer than having separate cron registration for each hostacct, but perhaps that's not important.
#
# This approach has the benefit of accumulating a single outcome of all operations dispatched each hour under a single trace log.
# Because support for all hostaccts is managed centrally, there's no good reason to log this stuff per account.
#
# Under this scheme the following rules should be followed by all scripts involved across all accounts:
#   - Processing must not hang (read data from STDIN) or require minutes to execute. We need to complete whole cycles well within an hour even at full load.
#   - All information that might be useful for monitoring status or task completion can simply go to STDERR and STDOUT, but cannot be interactive.
#   - Any problem with reporting to the administrator should be immediately sent as an email and processing should continue as best it can.
#
