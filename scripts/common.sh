eval "export usage_$FNAME=\"usage: $FNAME  [ {directory} [ ... ] ]

For each argument given, addpath ensures it is a traversable directory and canonicalizes it (normalizing symlinks).
Then the current path is checked to see if the directory is already there.
If the canonical directory is not already in your path, it is added to the front of the path.
Otherwise the argument is skipped and any other paths provided are processed in the same way.

$FNAME always displays the current path to stdout (&1) as it finishes.
Without an argument, $FNAME displays this message to stdout as well.
Handling of individual arguments (as added or not) is reported to stderr (&2).

FNAME=findall
eval "export usage_$FNAME=\"usage: $FNAME [ -w{more_grep_options} | -g{grep_options} ] { search_regex } [ path_top ] [ find_options ... ]
        search_regex is an extended regex of the text you're searching for in the files in the tree.
        path_top defaults to '.', i.e. the current directory; if it's not a directory, we assume it's not a path_top.
        grep_options defaults to 'li' to provide a list of files containing the text sought using case insensitive matching;
            your specification overrides this entirely to fully specify egrep's options
                NOTE THE LACK OF SPACE BETWEEN THE -g AND THE GREP_OPTIONS! (That's intended. See examples.)
        The -w ('where') option is the same as -gHni, ie. show matching lines along with their locations.

notes:
        Your find_options will appear first in the order of arguments to the find command.
        We always exclude .bzr and .idea directories and only process file names which don't end in ~ .
        The last option to the find command will be the -exec egrep operation.

examples:
        $FNAME actionresult ; # simple case insensitive search in current directory's hierarchy producing list of filenames
        $FNAME -w capcelaction lib -maxdepth 2 -name '*.php' ; # matches with locations from PHP files, shallow from lib/
        $FNAME -g CapcelContext -name '*.php'; # case sensitive dump of only matching lines from PHP files

The email body, which begin with any additional headers and a blank line, must be provided on STDIN.

To, Cc, and Bcc addresses may be provided as comma-separated lists.
    Providing multiple instances of a particular option appends to these lists.
