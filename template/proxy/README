proxy.conf is the top-level world-facing aspect of the account's presence via Apache.
	Each active account's proxy.conf is included by $ADMIN_HOME/proxy/local.conf; 
	when an account is added, its Include directive must be appended there.
	Typically for each site, account and site variables are set and then 
	$ADMIN_HOME/proxy/domain.conf is included to implement open and secure vhosts.

services.conf is the aggregator for services within this account.
	It is here that service-site relationships can be implemented.
	Its role is defined by $ADMIN_HOME/proxy/domain.conf; if that's not used, this need not be.
	It is included once per vhost under the proxy, which means once
	per disposition (open vs secure) per domain. ${DISPOSITION} will be defined as 'open' or
	'secure' as it is called, as will ${HANDLE}, ${DOMAIN}, ${PORTBASE}, etc. as established
	in proxy.conf.

certs/${HANDLE}.pem is where to find the public certificates for the secured server for each site.
keys/${HANDLE}.pem is where to find the private keys for the secured server for each site.
	These directories' contents are managed only by the PKI management functions in pki.sh,
	especially pkiNewSite.

The docroot directory is only there to serve as a backup location for a site which does not have
	the static web service configured. It needs to be present, but need not be used.

The test directory serves as the account's sites' apache ServerRoot. It's where log files for each
	site's secure and open configurations can be found. For the production server, those are 
	found here in this directory. 

Most of the files here will be apache log files, 4 for each site/domain: 
	The 2 per vhost are for *.errors.log and *.access.log.
	The 2 vhosts are the open (no naming effect), and secure (within the log file name).
	The log files will be owned by the running proxy server, which is www-data for the prod.

The group of this directory must be $ADMIN_GROUP and the directory must grant write permission to group.
