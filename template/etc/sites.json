The first blank line terminates the list of sites.
Each line contains the following fields:
	- a short handle by which to identify the site
	- the world-facing (proxy-held) domain name for general use 
	- the portbase for service proxied services for that site on localhost
	- list of services enabled for the site

The domain name on which the local and actual HTTPD server instances run is defined by the system
as localhost:${SERVICE_PORT}
